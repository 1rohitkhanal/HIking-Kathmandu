        <p>🌊 Reasons for Its Popularity
          <br>
          - Myth & Legend: According to local belief, when the Buddhist saint Manjushree drained the ancient lake that once covered Kathmandu Valley, serpent deities (Nāgas) took refuge in Taudaha. The name itself means Snake Lake (Ta = snake, Daha = lake).
          <br>
          - Spiritual Importance: People still visit to offer milk and worship the Nāgas, believing it brings prosperity, rainfall, and protection of water sources.
          <br>
          - Natural Beauty: It's one of the few remaining natural lakes in the valley, surrounded by greenery and offering a peaceful escape from the city.
          <br>
          - Birdwatching Spot: Taudaha attracts migratory and local birds, making it popular among nature lovers and photographers.
          <br>
          - Cultural Blend: The lake is tied to both Buddhist and Hindu traditions, giving it a unique spiritual aura.
